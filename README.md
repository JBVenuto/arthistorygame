## Description
This is a memory game that uses popular pieces of art throughout history. The goal of the game is to click on each picture without clicking on the same picture twice. However, each time a picture is clicked the order of all the pictures is changed.

## Technology Used
The game is build as a way to help learn and understand React. Because of this it focuses heavily on the React library which uses JavaScrip, CSS, JSX, and HTML. I also use BootStrap in this application. The art comes from The Met's collection of open access artworks.
